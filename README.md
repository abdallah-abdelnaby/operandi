# OPERANDI
This is the OPERANDI project's repository. The documentation is currently under construction.

## 1. Introduction
OPERANDI is one of the implementation projects funded by the DFG initiative OCR-D. The main goal of OCR-D is the 
conceptual and technical preparation of the full-text transformation of the 16th to 18th-century prints published in 
the German language area. The task of automatic full-text recognition is broken down into individual process steps, 
which can be reproduced in the open-source OCR-D software. This makes it possible to create optimal workflows for 
the prints to be processed, and thus generate scientifically usable full texts.

The goal of OPERANDI is to develop and build an OCR-D-based implementation package for mass full-text capture with 
improved throughput while improving the quality of the results. At the same time, the goal is that the implementation 
package can also be used by other projects and institutions with comparable requirements. Two scenarios were identified 
during the pilot. In the first scenario, OCR generation is to take place for works that have already been digitized, 
resulting in mass full-text capture. In the second scenario, OCR generation for new works to be digitized will take 
place as part of the digitization process.
